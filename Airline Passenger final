---outcomes for the project --

--1. sorted by age, Travelling class and flight distance
--2. We have grouped the data accocding to there age in two categories between 18 and 40 , 41 to 60 as its 85.5% of data
--3. Also we have grouped all the passengers in two class **ECO CLASS** and **BUSINESS CLASS** as its 93.6% of total paseengers 
--4. For distance we have taken distance less thenn 1200 km as its 65% of total passenger 

--we have created 4 categories of passenger using above varibale and calculate avg ratinng of all the categories
--which can be seen below using thw following command 

--select * from passenger_final

--5.Based on the above Rating we have created action plan for the air line in three phases 
--  (a) Immidiate action :- where the avg rating are below three
--	(b) Moderate action :- where the avg rating lies between 3 to 3.5
--	(c) Maintain :- Where avg ratings is above 3.5 

--6. Immidiate action required for 
--  (a) wifi service and online bookings for all categories
--  (b) Departrial arrival time and in (18-40) age in business class
--	(c) Online boarding for (18-40) age of Eco class 

--7. Moderate action required for 
--  (a) Gate location and food & drink for all the categories  
--	(b) depratial arrival timing of all the categories 
--	    execpt Business class (18-40) they need imidiate action
--	(c) Online boarding in Business class (18-40) and Eco class (41-60)
--	(d) seat comfort in all the catefories 
--	    except Business class (41-60)
--	(e) Inflight entertainment in all the categories 
--	    except  Business class (41-60)
--	(f) On boarding service for both Eco class (18-40) and (41-60)
